# What?
A tool to add a traefic-service to a redis-db
# Why?
I couldn't be bothered to remember the exact keys necessary to do so
# How?
## Via cli-arguments
All parameters can be set via cli. If a config is found cli-parameters take precedence. Use the -h option to print all parameters.
## Via config-file
pipe the -cfgxmpl option to a file (cfg.json would be autoloaded) and alter it to your desires.
